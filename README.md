# pontasan-skills

A collection of custom skills for Claude Code.

## Demo

The GIF below was created entirely by Claude Code — it first generated a static image using **pontasan-genimg**, then autonomously animated it into a video using **pontasan-genmov**. No manual intervention was needed; Claude Code handled the entire image-to-video pipeline on its own.

Here's an example of Claude Code automatically generating images while building a cafe landing page.

The finished website built with the generated images:

## Skills

### pontasan-genimg

An AI image generation skill powered by the Google Gemini API. Automatically generates image assets (icons, illustrations, backgrounds, logos, banners, etc.) needed during frontend development.

#### Features

- Generates images using Google Gemini API
- Supports both binary images (PNG, JPEG, WebP) and vector graphics (SVG)
- Two generation modes: **fast** (default) and **quality** (use when high quality is truly needed)
- Automatically respects API rate limits (RPM / TPM / RPD)

#### Requirements

- Node.js (developed on v24, but likely works on other versions)

#### Setup

1. Get a [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd skills/pontasan-genimg/script
npm install
```

### pontasan-genmov

An AI video generation skill powered by Google Gemini Veo. Generates video (MP4/GIF) from text prompts or images. Ideal for creating animated versions of static images, as well as generating videos from text descriptions.

#### Features

- Generates videos using Google Gemini Veo API
- Supports text-to-video and image-to-video generation
- Three generation modes: **fast** (default, veo-2.0), **quality** (veo-3.1-fast), and **ultra** (veo-3.1)
- Output formats: MP4 and GIF (requires ffmpeg for GIF conversion)
- Optional audio generation (off by default to reduce file size)
- Automatic audio stripping via ffmpeg (graceful degradation if ffmpeg is not installed)
- Automatically respects API rate limits (RPM / RPD)

#### Requirements

- Node.js (developed on v24, but likely works on other versions)
- ffmpeg (optional, required for GIF conversion and audio stripping)

#### Setup

1. Get a [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd skills/pontasan-genmov/script
npm install
```
